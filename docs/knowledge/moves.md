# Move format

Each entry says how it is known: **tested** (seen in game), **code** (read in the projects' source), or **inferred**.

## Move format (code: Expanded `tools/ttt1/moves.py`, `combat_semantics.py`)

- Expanded converts whole TTT1 movesets into Tekken 3's engine: records, clips, cancel lists,
  input sequences, reaction rows, pushback curves, contact groups. Damage, attacking bones and
  active frames are preserved.
- Move records are 56 bytes (`src/tekken3_ttt1_combat.c`, `record_owner`).
- Packs: `<n>-TTT1-combat.jmv` and `<n>-TTT1-tables.jst`.
- Next step: document the record fields from these tools, then the "hello world" experiment
  (change one move's damage for one custom fighter only).
